# VBA-challenge
This repository contains a VBA script to analyse the stock data for multiple years. 
It finds the yearly price change, percentage of price change and stock volume per year for each ticker.
Also finds the greatest percentage of increase and decrease in the price and greatest stock volume for each year.
The script needs to be run only once for all the sheets and analysis will be added to each sheet.
